abstract: 'oÌ§pyright 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Defence against pathogenic infection
  can take two forms: resistance and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host
  to limit a pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the negative
  consequences of infection at a given level of infection intensity. Evolutionarily,
  a tolerance strategy that is independent of resistance could allow the host to avoid
  mounting a costly immune response and, theoretically, to avoid a co-evolutionary
  arms race between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Biomedically, understanding
  the mechanisms of tolerance and how they relate to resistance could potentially
  yield treatment strategies that focus on health improvement instead of pathogen
  elimination. To understand the impact of tolerance on host defence and identify
  genetic variants that determine host tolerance, we defined genetic variation in
  tolerance as the residual deviation from a binomial regression of fitness under
  infection against infection intensity. We then performed a genomewide association
  study to map the genetic basis of variation in resistance to and tolerance of infection
  by the bacterium Providencia rettgeri. We found a positive genetic correlation between
  resistance and tolerance, and we demonstrated that the level of resistance is highly
  predictive of tolerance. We identified 30 loci that predict tolerance, many of which
  are in genes involved in the regulation of immunity and metabolism. We used RNAi
  to confirm that a subset of mapped genes have a role in defence, including putative
  wound repair genes grainy head and debris buster. Our results indicate that tolerance
  is not an independent strategy from resistance, but that defence arises from a collection
  of physiological processes intertwined with canonical immunity and resistance.'
