pathogenic infection can take two forms: resistance and
tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to limit a
pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the
negative consequences of infection at a given level of infection
intensity. Evolutionarily, a tolerance strategy that is
independent of resistance could allow the host to avoid mounting
a costly immune response and, theoretically, to avoid a
co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen virulence and host
resistance. Biomedically, understanding the mechanisms of
tolerance and how they relate to resistance could potentially
yield treatment strategies that focus on health improvement
instead of pathogen elimination. To understand the impact of
tolerance on host defence and identify genetic variants that
determine host tolerance, we defined genetic variation in
tolerance as the residual deviation from a binomial regression of
fitness under infection against infection intensity. We then
performed a genomewide association study to map the genetic basis
of variation in resistance to and tolerance of infection by the
bacterium Providencia rettgeri. We found a positive genetic
correlation between resistance and tolerance, and we demonstrated
that the level of resistance is highly predictive of tolerance.
We identified 30 loci that predict tolerance, many of which are
in genes involved in the regulation of immunity and metabolism.
We used RNAi to confirm that a subset of mapped genes have a role
in defence, including putative wound repair genes grainy head and
debris buster. Our results indicate that tolerance is not an
independent strategy from resistance, but that defence arises
from a collection of physiological processes intertwined with
canonical immunity and resistance.},
