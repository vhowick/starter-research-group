abstract: Early diverging lineages such as trypanosomes can provide
                 clues to the evolution of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.
                 In Trypanosoma brucei, the pathogen that causes Human African
                 Trypanosomiasis, sexual reproduction occurs in the salivary
                 glands of the insect host, but analysis of the molecular
                 signatures that define these sexual forms is complicated
                 because they mingle with more numerous, mitotically-dividing
                 developmental stages. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing
                 (scRNAseq) to profile 388 individual trypanosomes from midgut,
                 proventriculus, and salivary glands of infected tsetse flies
                 allowing us to identify tissue-specific cell types. Further
                 investigation of salivary gland parasite transcriptomes
                 revealed fine-scale changes in gene expression over a
                 developmental progression from putative sexual forms through
                 metacyclics expressing variant surface glycoprotein genes. The
                 cluster of cells potentially containing sexual forms was
                 characterized by high level transcription of the gamete fusion
                 protein HAP2, together with an array of surface proteins and
                 several genes of unknown function. We linked these expression
                 patterns to distinct morphological forms using
                 immunofluorescence assays and reporter gene expression to
                 demonstrate that the kinetoplastid-conserved gene
                 Tb927.10.12080 is exclusively expressed at high levels by
                 meiotic intermediates and gametes. Further experiments are
                 required to establish whether this protein, currently of
                 unknown function, plays a role in gamete formation and/or
                 fusion.
