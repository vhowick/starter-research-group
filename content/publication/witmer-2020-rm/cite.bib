 abstract = {Resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the
Plasmodium falciparum parasite is threatening to reverse recent
gains in reducing global deaths from malaria. While resistance
manifests as delayed parasite clearance in patients, the
phenotype can only spread geographically via the sexual stages
and mosquito transmission. In addition to their asexual killing
properties, artemisinin and its derivatives sterilize sexual male
gametocytes. Whether resistant parasites overcome this
sterilizing effect has not, however, been fully tested. Here, we
analyzed P. falciparum clinical isolates from the Greater Mekong
Subregion, each demonstrating delayed clinical clearance and
known resistance-associated polymorphisms in the Kelch13
(PfK13var) gene. As well as demonstrating reduced asexual
sensitivity to drug, certain PfK13var isolates demonstrated a
marked reduction in sensitivity to artemisinin in an in vitro
male gamete formation assay. Importantly, this same reduction in
sensitivity was observed when the most resistant isolate was
tested directly in mosquito feeds. These results indicate that,
under artemisinin drug pressure, while sensitive parasites are
blocked, resistant parasites continue transmission. This
selective advantage for resistance transmission could favor
acquisition of additional host-specificity or polymorphisms
affecting partner drug sensitivity in mixed infections. Favored
resistance transmission under ACT coverage could have profound
implications for the spread of multidrug-resistant malaria beyond
Southeast Asia.},
