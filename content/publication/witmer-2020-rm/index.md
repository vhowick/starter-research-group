abstract: Resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the Plasmodium
  falciparum parasite is threatening to reverse recent gains in reducing global deaths
  from malaria. While resistance manifests as delayed parasite clearance in patients,
  the phenotype can only spread geographically via the sexual stages and mosquito
  transmission. In addition to their asexual killing properties, artemisinin and its
  derivatives sterilize sexual male gametocytes. Whether resistant parasites overcome
  this sterilizing effect has not, however, been fully tested. Here, we analyzed P.
  falciparum clinical isolates from the Greater Mekong Subregion, each demonstrating
  delayed clinical clearance and known resistance-associated polymorphisms in the
  Kelch13 (PfK13var) gene. As well as demonstrating reduced asexual sensitivity to
  drug, certain PfK13var isolates demonstrated a marked reduction in sensitivity to
  artemisinin in an in vitro male gamete formation assay. Importantly, this same reduction
  in sensitivity was observed when the most resistant isolate was tested directly
  in mosquito feeds. These results indicate that, under artemisinin drug pressure,
  while sensitive parasites are blocked, resistant parasites continue transmission.
  This selective advantage for resistance transmission could favor acquisition of
  additional host-specificity or polymorphisms affecting partner drug sensitivity
  in mixed infections. Favored resistance transmission under ACT coverage could have
  profound implications for the spread of multidrug-resistant malaria beyond Southeast
  Asia.
