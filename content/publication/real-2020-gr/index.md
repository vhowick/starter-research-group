abstract: 'Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle featuring diverse developmental
  strategies, each uniquely adapted to navigate specific host environments. Here we
  use single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate gene usage across the transmission
  cycle of the most virulent agent of human malaria -- Plasmodium falciparum . We
  reveal developmental trajectories associated with the colonisation of the mosquito
  midgut and salivary glands and elucidate the transcriptional signatures of each
  transmissible stage. Additionally, we identify both conserved and nonconserved gene
  usage between human and rodent parasites, which point to both essential mechanisms
  in malaria transmission and species-specific adaptations potentially linked to host
  tropism. Together, the data presented here, which are made freely available via
  an interactive website, establish the most complete atlas of the P. falciparum transcriptional
  journey to date. One sentence summary Single-cell transcriptomics of P. falciparum
  transmission stages highlights developmental trajectories and gene usage. ### Competing
  Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.'
