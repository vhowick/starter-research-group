 abstract = {Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle featuring diverse
developmental strategies, each uniquely adapted to navigate
specific host environments. Here we use single-cell
transcriptomics to illuminate gene usage across the transmission
cycle of the most virulent agent of human malaria -- Plasmodium
falciparum . We reveal developmental trajectories associated with
the colonisation of the mosquito midgut and salivary glands and
elucidate the transcriptional signatures of each transmissible
stage. Additionally, we identify both conserved and nonconserved
gene usage between human and rodent parasites, which point to
both essential mechanisms in malaria transmission and
species-specific adaptations potentially linked to host tropism.
Together, the data presented here, which are made freely
available via an interactive website, establish the most complete
atlas of the P. falciparum transcriptional journey to date. One
sentence summary Single-cell transcriptomics of P. falciparum
transmission stages highlights developmental trajectories and
gene usage. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have
