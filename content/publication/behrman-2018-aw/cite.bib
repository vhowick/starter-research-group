change and the genetic architecture that facilitates rapid
adaptation is a current challenge in evolutionary biology.
Comparative studies show that genes with immune function are
among the most rapidly evolving genes across a range of taxa.
Here, we use immune defence in natural populations of Drosophila
melanogaster to understand the rate of evolution in natural
populations and the genetics underlying rapid change. We probed
the immune system using the natural pathogens Enterococcus
faecalis and Providencia rettgeri to measure post-infection
survival and bacterial load of wild D. melanogaster populations
collected across seasonal time along a latitudinal transect along
eastern North America (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia).
There are pronounced and repeatable changes in the immune
response over the approximately 10 generations between spring and
autumn collections, with a significant but less distinct
difference observed among geographical locations. Genes with
known immune function are not enriched among alleles that cycle
with seasonal time, but the immune function of a subset of
seasonally cycling alleles in immune genes was tested using
reconstructed outbred populations. We find that flies containing
seasonal alleles in Thioester-containing protein 3 (Tep3) have
different functional responses to infection and that epistatic
interactions among seasonal Tep3 and Drosomycin-like 6 (Dro6)
alleles underlie the immune phenotypes observed in natural
populations. This rapid, cyclic response to seasonal
environmental pressure broadens our understanding of the complex
ecological and genetic interactions determining the evolution of
immune defence in natural populations.},
