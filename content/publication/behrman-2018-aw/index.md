abstract: oÌ§pyright 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights
  reserved. Understanding the rate of evolutionary change and the genetic architecture
  that facilitates rapid adaptation is a current challenge in evolutionary biology.
  Comparative studies show that genes with immune function are among the most rapidly
  evolving genes across a range of taxa. Here, we use immune defence in natural populations
  of Drosophila melanogaster to understand the rate of evolution in natural populations
  and the genetics underlying rapid change. We probed the immune system using the
  natural pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia rettgeri to measure post-infection
  survival and bacterial load of wild D. melanogaster populations collected across
  seasonal time along a latitudinal transect along eastern North America (Massachusetts,
  Pennsylvania and Virginia). There are pronounced and repeatable changes in the immune
  response over the approximately 10 generations between spring and autumn collections,
  with a significant but less distinct difference observed among geographical locations.
  Genes with known immune function are not enriched among alleles that cycle with
  seasonal time, but the immune function of a subset of seasonally cycling alleles
  in immune genes was tested using reconstructed outbred populations. We find that
  flies containing seasonal alleles in Thioester-containing protein 3 (Tep3) have
  different functional responses to infection and that epistatic interactions among
  seasonal Tep3 and Drosomycin-like 6 (Dro6) alleles underlie the immune phenotypes
  observed in natural populations. This rapid, cyclic response to seasonal environmental
  pressure broadens our understanding of the complex ecological and genetic interactions
  determining the evolution of immune defence in natural populations.
