 abstract = {Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle featuring diverse
developmental strategies, each uniquely adapted to navigate
specific host environments. Here we use single-cell
transcriptomics to illuminate gene usage across the transmission
cycle of the most virulent agent of human malaria - Plasmodium
falciparum. We reveal developmental trajectories associated with
the colonization of the mosquito midgut and salivary glands and
elucidate the transcriptional signatures of each transmissible
stage. Additionally, we identify both conserved and non-conserved
gene usage between human and rodent parasites, which point to
both essential mechanisms in malaria transmission and
species-specific adaptations potentially linked to host tropism.
Together, the data presented here, which are made freely
available via an interactive website, provide a fine-grained
atlas that enables intensive investigation of the P. falciparum
transcriptional journey. As well as providing insights into gene
function across the transmission cycle, the atlas opens the door
for identification of drug and vaccine targets to stop malaria
transmission and thereby prevent disease.},
