abstract: Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle featuring diverse developmental
  strategies, each uniquely adapted to navigate specific host environments. Here we
  use single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate gene usage across the transmission
  cycle of the most virulent agent of human malaria - Plasmodium falciparum. We reveal
  developmental trajectories associated with the colonization of the mosquito midgut
  and salivary glands and elucidate the transcriptional signatures of each transmissible
  stage. Additionally, we identify both conserved and non-conserved gene usage between
  human and rodent parasites, which point to both essential mechanisms in malaria
  transmission and species-specific adaptations potentially linked to host tropism.
  Together, the data presented here, which are made freely available via an interactive
  website, provide a fine-grained atlas that enables intensive investigation of the
  P. falciparum transcriptional journey. As well as providing insights into gene function
  across the transmission cycle, the atlas opens the door for identification of drug
  and vaccine targets to stop malaria transmission and thereby prevent disease.
