abstract: 'Background: Host defense against pathogenic infection is composed of resistance
  and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to limit a pathogen burden,
  whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the deleterious effects of a given pathogen
  burden. This distinction recognizes that the fittest host does not necessarily have
  the most aggressive immune system, suggesting that host-pathogen co-evolution involves
  more than an escalating arms race between pathogen virulence factors and host antimicrobial
  activity. How a host balances resistance and tolerance and how this balance influences
  the evolution of host defense remains unanswered. In order to determine how genotype-by-diet
  interactions and evolutionary costs of each strategy may constrain the evolution
  of host defense, we measured survival, fecundity, and pathogen burden over five
  days in ten genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster reared on two diets and infected
  with the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Providencia rettgeri. Results: We demonstrated
  two distinct phases of infection: an acute phase that consists of high mortality,
  low fecundity, and high pathogen loads, and a chronic phase where there was a substantial
  but stable pathogen load and mortality and fecundity returned to uninfected levels.
  We demonstrated genetic variation for resistance in both phases of infection, but
  found genetic variation for tolerance only in the acute phase. We found genotype-by-diet
  interactions for tolerance, especially in the acute phase, but genotype-by-diet
  interaction did not significantly shape resistance. We found a diet-dependent positive
  relationship between resistance and tolerance and a weak evolutionary cost of resistance,
  but did not detect any costs of tolerance. Conclusions: Existing models of tolerance
  and resistance are overly simplistic. Multi-phase infections such as that studied
  here are rarely considered, but we show important differences in determination and
  evolutionary constraints on tolerance and resistance over the two phases of infection.
  Our observation of genetic variation for tolerance is inconsistent with simple models
  that predict evolutionary fixation of tolerance alleles, and instead indicate that
  genetic variation for resistance and tolerance is likely to be maintained by non-independence
  between resistance and tolerance, condition-dependent evolutionary costs, and environmental
  heterogeneity. oÌ§pyright 2014 Howick and Lazzaro; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'
