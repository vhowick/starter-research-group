 abstract = {Background: Host defense against pathogenic infection is composed
of resistance and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the
host to limit a pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability
to limit the deleterious effects of a given pathogen burden. This
distinction recognizes that the fittest host does not necessarily
have the most aggressive immune system, suggesting that
host-pathogen co-evolution involves more than an escalating arms
race between pathogen virulence factors and host antimicrobial
activity. How a host balances resistance and tolerance and how
this balance influences the evolution of host defense remains
unanswered. In order to determine how genotype-by-diet
interactions and evolutionary costs of each strategy may
constrain the evolution of host defense, we measured survival,
fecundity, and pathogen burden over five days in ten genotypes of
Drosophila melanogaster reared on two diets and infected with the
Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Providencia rettgeri. Results:
We demonstrated two distinct phases of infection: an acute phase
that consists of high mortality, low fecundity, and high pathogen
loads, and a chronic phase where there was a substantial but
stable pathogen load and mortality and fecundity returned to
uninfected levels. We demonstrated genetic variation for
resistance in both phases of infection, but found genetic
variation for tolerance only in the acute phase. We found
genotype-by-diet interactions for tolerance, especially in the
acute phase, but genotype-by-diet interaction did not
significantly shape resistance. We found a diet-dependent
positive relationship between resistance and tolerance and a weak
evolutionary cost of resistance, but did not detect any costs of
tolerance. Conclusions: Existing models of tolerance and
resistance are overly simplistic. Multi-phase infections such as
that studied here are rarely considered, but we show important
differences in determination and evolutionary constraints on
tolerance and resistance over the two phases of infection. Our
observation of genetic variation for tolerance is inconsistent
with simple models that predict evolutionary fixation of
tolerance alleles, and instead indicate that genetic variation
for resistance and tolerance is likely to be maintained by
non-independence between resistance and tolerance,
condition-dependent evolutionary costs, and environmental
heterogeneity. oÌ§pyright 2014 Howick and Lazzaro; licensee
