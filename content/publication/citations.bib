              Plasmodium falciparum parasite is threatening to reverse recent
              gains in reducing global deaths from malaria. While resistance
              manifests as delayed parasite clearance in patients, the
              phenotype can only spread geographically via the sexual stages
              and mosquito transmission. In addition to their asexual killing
              properties, artemisinin and its derivatives sterilize sexual male
              gametocytes. Whether resistant parasites overcome this
              sterilizing effect has not, however, been fully tested. Here, we
              analyzed P. falciparum clinical isolates from the Greater Mekong
              Subregion, each demonstrating delayed clinical clearance and
              known resistance-associated polymorphisms in the Kelch13
              (PfK13var) gene. As well as demonstrating reduced asexual
              sensitivity to drug, certain PfK13var isolates demonstrated a
              marked reduction in sensitivity to artemisinin in an in vitro
              male gamete formation assay. Importantly, this same reduction in
              sensitivity was observed when the most resistant isolate was
              tested directly in mosquito feeds. These results indicate that,
              under artemisinin drug pressure, while sensitive parasites are
              blocked, resistant parasites continue transmission. This
              selective advantage for resistance transmission could favor
              acquisition of additional host-specificity or polymorphisms
              affecting partner drug sensitivity in mixed infections. Favored
              resistance transmission under ACT coverage could have profound
              implications for the spread of multidrug-resistant malaria beyond

              of contracting malaria. While pathogenesis results from
              replication of asexual forms in human red blood cells, it is the
              sexually differentiated forms, gametocytes, which are responsible
              for the spread of the disease. For transmission to succeed, both
              mature male and female gametocytes must be taken up by a female
              Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal for subsequent
              differentiation into gametes and mating inside the mosquito gut.
              Observed circulating numbers of gametocytes in the human host are
              often surprisingly low, yet even sub-patently infected carriers
              are able to transmit malaria. A pre-fertilisation associative
              behaviour has been hypothesised to explain the efficiency of
              human-to-mosquito transmission but has not been sufficiently
              tested due to a lack of appropriate tools. In this study, we
              describe the optimisation of a qPCR tool that enables the

  title    = "Genotype and diet shape resistance and tolerance across distinct
              phases of bacterial infection",
  author   = "Howick, V M and Lazzaro, B P",
  abstract = "Background: Host defense against pathogenic infection is composed
              of resistance and tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the
              host to limit a pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability
              to limit the deleterious effects of a given pathogen burden. This
              distinction recognizes that the fittest host does not necessarily
              have the most aggressive immune system, suggesting that
              host-pathogen co-evolution involves more than an escalating arms
              race between pathogen virulence factors and host antimicrobial
              activity. How a host balances resistance and tolerance and how
              this balance influences the evolution of host defense remains
              unanswered. In order to determine how genotype-by-diet
              interactions and evolutionary costs of each strategy may
              constrain the evolution of host defense, we measured survival,
              fecundity, and pathogen burden over five days in ten genotypes of
              Drosophila melanogaster reared on two diets and infected with the
              Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Providencia rettgeri. Results:
              We demonstrated two distinct phases of infection: an acute phase
              that consists of high mortality, low fecundity, and high pathogen
              loads, and a chronic phase where there was a substantial but
              stable pathogen load and mortality and fecundity returned to
              uninfected levels. We demonstrated genetic variation for
              resistance in both phases of infection, but found genetic
              variation for tolerance only in the acute phase. We found
              genotype-by-diet interactions for tolerance, especially in the
              acute phase, but genotype-by-diet interaction did not
              significantly shape resistance. We found a diet-dependent
              positive relationship between resistance and tolerance and a weak
              evolutionary cost of resistance, but did not detect any costs of
              tolerance. Conclusions: Existing models of tolerance and
              resistance are overly simplistic. Multi-phase infections such as
              that studied here are rarely considered, but we show important
              differences in determination and evolutionary constraints on
              tolerance and resistance over the two phases of infection. Our
              observation of genetic variation for tolerance is inconsistent
              with simple models that predict evolutionary fixation of
              tolerance alleles, and instead indicate that genetic variation
              for resistance and tolerance is likely to be maintained by
              non-independence between resistance and tolerance,
              condition-dependent evolutionary costs, and environmental
              heterogeneity. \copyright{} 2014 Howick and Lazzaro; licensee

              pathogenic infection can take two forms: resistance and
              tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to limit a
              pathogen burden, whereas tolerance is the ability to limit the
              negative consequences of infection at a given level of infection
              intensity. Evolutionarily, a tolerance strategy that is
              independent of resistance could allow the host to avoid mounting
              a costly immune response and, theoretically, to avoid a
              co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen virulence and host
              resistance. Biomedically, understanding the mechanisms of
              tolerance and how they relate to resistance could potentially
              yield treatment strategies that focus on health improvement
              instead of pathogen elimination. To understand the impact of
              tolerance on host defence and identify genetic variants that
              determine host tolerance, we defined genetic variation in
              tolerance as the residual deviation from a binomial regression of
              fitness under infection against infection intensity. We then
              performed a genomewide association study to map the genetic basis
              of variation in resistance to and tolerance of infection by the
              bacterium Providencia rettgeri. We found a positive genetic
              correlation between resistance and tolerance, and we demonstrated
              that the level of resistance is highly predictive of tolerance.
              We identified 30 loci that predict tolerance, many of which are
              in genes involved in the regulation of immunity and metabolism.
              We used RNAi to confirm that a subset of mapped genes have a role
              in defence, including putative wound repair genes grainy head and
              debris buster. Our results indicate that tolerance is not an
              independent strategy from resistance, but that defence arises
              from a collection of physiological processes intertwined with
              canonical immunity and resistance.",

              change and the genetic architecture that facilitates rapid
              adaptation is a current challenge in evolutionary biology.
              Comparative studies show that genes with immune function are
              among the most rapidly evolving genes across a range of taxa.
              Here, we use immune defence in natural populations of Drosophila
              melanogaster to understand the rate of evolution in natural
              populations and the genetics underlying rapid change. We probed
              the immune system using the natural pathogens Enterococcus
              faecalis and Providencia rettgeri to measure post-infection
              survival and bacterial load of wild D. melanogaster populations
              collected across seasonal time along a latitudinal transect along
              eastern North America (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia).
              There are pronounced and repeatable changes in the immune
              response over the approximately 10 generations between spring and
              autumn collections, with a significant but less distinct
              difference observed among geographical locations. Genes with
              known immune function are not enriched among alleles that cycle
              with seasonal time, but the immune function of a subset of
              seasonally cycling alleles in immune genes was tested using
              reconstructed outbred populations. We find that flies containing
              seasonal alleles in Thioester-containing protein 3 (Tep3) have
              different functional responses to infection and that epistatic
              interactions among seasonal Tep3 and Drosomycin-like 6 (Dro6)
              alleles underlie the immune phenotypes observed in natural
              populations. This rapid, cyclic response to seasonal
              environmental pressure broadens our understanding of the complex
