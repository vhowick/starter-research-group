abstract: Plasmodium falciparum remains one of the leading causes of child mortality,
  and nearly half of the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria. While
  pathogenesis results from replication of asexual forms in human red blood cells,
  it is the sexually differentiated forms, gametocytes, which are responsible for
  the spread of the disease. For transmission to succeed, both mature male and female
  gametocytes must be taken up by a female Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal
  for subsequent differentiation into gametes and mating inside the mosquito gut.
  Observed circulating numbers of gametocytes in the human host are often surprisingly
  low, yet even sub-patently infected carriers are able to transmit malaria. A pre-fertilisation
  associative behaviour has been hypothesised to explain the efficiency of human-to-mosquito
  transmission but has not been sufficiently tested due to a lack of appropriate tools.
  In this study, we describe the optimisation of a qPCR tool that enables the relative
  quantification of gametocytes within very small input samples. Such a tool allows
  for the quantification of gametocytes in different compartments of the host and
  the vector that could potentially unravel mechanisms that enable highly efficient
  malaria transmission. We demonstrate the use of our gametocyte quantification method
  in mosquito blood meals from both direct skin feeding on Plasmodium gametocyte carriers
  and standard membrane feeding assay. Relative gametocyte abundance was not different
  between mosquitoes fed through a membrane or directly on the skin suggesting that
  there is no systematic enrichment of gametocytes picked up in the skin.
