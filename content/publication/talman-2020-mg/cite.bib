 abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum remains one of the leading causes of child
mortality, and nearly half of the world's population is at risk
of contracting malaria. While pathogenesis results from
replication of asexual forms in human red blood cells, it is the
sexually differentiated forms, gametocytes, which are responsible
for the spread of the disease. For transmission to succeed, both
mature male and female gametocytes must be taken up by a female
Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal for subsequent
differentiation into gametes and mating inside the mosquito gut.
Observed circulating numbers of gametocytes in the human host are
often surprisingly low, yet even sub-patently infected carriers
are able to transmit malaria. A pre-fertilisation associative
behaviour has been hypothesised to explain the efficiency of
human-to-mosquito transmission but has not been sufficiently
tested due to a lack of appropriate tools. In this study, we
describe the optimisation of a qPCR tool that enables the
relative quantification of gametocytes within very small input
samples. Such a tool allows for the quantification of gametocytes
in different compartments of the host and the vector that could
potentially unravel mechanisms that enable highly efficient
malaria transmission. We demonstrate the use of our gametocyte
quantification method in mosquito blood meals from both direct
skin feeding on Plasmodium gametocyte carriers and standard
membrane feeding assay. Relative gametocyte abundance was not
different between mosquitoes fed through a membrane or directly
on the skin suggesting that there is no systematic enrichment of
gametocytes picked up in the skin.},
