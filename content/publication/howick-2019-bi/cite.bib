 abstract = {Malaria parasites adopt a remarkable variety of morphological
life stages as they transition through multiple mammalian host
and mosquito vector environments. We profiled the single-cell
transcriptomes of thousands of individual parasites, deriving the
first high-resolution transcriptional atlas of the entire
Plasmodium berghei life cycle. We then used our atlas to
precisely define developmental stages of single cells from three
different human malaria parasite species, including parasites
isolated directly from infected individuals. The Malaria Cell
Atlas provides both a comprehensive view of gene usage in a
eukaryotic parasite and an open-access reference dataset for the
study of malaria parasites.},
