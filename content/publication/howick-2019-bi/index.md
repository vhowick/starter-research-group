abstract: Malaria parasites adopt a remarkable variety of morphological life stages
  as they transition through multiple mammalian host and mosquito vector environments.
  We profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual parasites,
  deriving the first high-resolution transcriptional atlas of the entire Plasmodium
  berghei life cycle. We then used our atlas to precisely define developmental stages
  of single cells from three different human malaria parasite species, including parasites
  isolated directly from infected individuals. The Malaria Cell Atlas provides both
  a comprehensive view of gene usage in a eukaryotic parasite and an open-access reference
  dataset for the study of malaria parasites.
