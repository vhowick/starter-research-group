I joined the Institute of Biodiversity, Comparative Medicine and Animal Health at the University of Glasgow in 2020 as a Research Fellow to study how malaria parasite populations are shaped by local adaption to vector species.

More generally I am interested in genotype-phenotype associations and how these associations vary based on enviornmental context.
