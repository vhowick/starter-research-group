I am interested in the molecular basis of transmission and drug resistance in Plasmodium spp. in order to study how to prevent malaria spreading. 

 I joined the Howick group at University of Glasgow in February 2021 to work on genome-editing in Plasmodium spp. and identify gene modifications in the parasite that play a role in transmission in various area.
