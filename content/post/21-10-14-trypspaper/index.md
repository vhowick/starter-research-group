Ginny's T. brucei single-cell paper is up on Biorxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.13.463681v2. This was a great collaboration with Wendy Gibson's group at Bristol! Highlights include visits to Langford, watching tryps swim, and tying patterns of gene expression to specific morphological forms.
