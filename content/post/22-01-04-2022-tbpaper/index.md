Ginny's T. brucei single-cell paper came out in PLoS Pathogens https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010346. This was a great collaboration with Wendy Gibson's group at Bristol! 

She also presented this work in the single cell symposium, organised by Thomas Otto and Matt Marti, at the ICOPA meeting in Copenhagen in August (see picture).
